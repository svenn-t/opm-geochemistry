/*
 * The International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam Lucerne, Switzerland
 * August 2007, Revised Release on the IAPWS Industrial Formulation 1997 (IAPWS-97).
 * (The revision only relates to the extension of region 5 to 50 MPa)
 *
 * Implemented regions:
 *
 *   - Region 1: compressed liquid, 273.15 K <= T <= 623.15 K, Psat(T) <= P <= 100 MPa
 *   - Region 2: steam/superheated vapour, 273.15 K <= T <= 1073.15 K,
 *               P below the saturation line (T <= 623.15 K) or below the B23
 *               boundary (623.15 K < T <= 863.15 K), P <= 100 MPa
 *   - Region 3: near-critical/supercritical, 623.15 K < T <= 863.15 K, above the
 *               B23 boundary, P <= 100 MPa (Helmholtz formulation, density is
 *               obtained with a safeguarded Newton iteration)
 *   - Region 4: the saturation line (PsatIAPWS)
 *
 * For 100 MPa < P <= 1000 MPa the IAPWS-95 scientific formulation is used
 * instead (Wagner & Pruss, J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 31 (2002) 387; single
 * Helmholtz equation, here restricted to 273.15 K <= T <= 1073.15 K).
 * Note: the melting line is NOT checked, so at low temperature and very high
 * pressure (roughly P > 632 MPa at 273 K, the ice VI field) the returned
 * properties refer to the metastable liquid.
 *
 * Region 5 (T > 1073.15 K) is not implemented. Conditions outside the covered
 * ranges raise std::domain_error.
